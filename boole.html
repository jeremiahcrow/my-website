      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Born in Lincoln, England, Boole was largely self-taught. He excelled in mathematics and became a professor at Queen's College, Cork.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Major Contributions</h2>
      <p>Boole’s book *The Laws of Thought* introduced Boolean algebra, which uses binary true/false logic.</p>

    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Impact on AI</h2>
      <p>Boolean logic is essential for digital circuits and AI reasoning systems. Without it, modern computing and machine learning would not exist.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>Every search engine query, computer program, and AI model still relies on Boolean logic at its core.</p>
