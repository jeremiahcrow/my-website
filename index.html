I sincerely apologize for the persistent issue. It seems there's a problem with the way images are being handled. The previous image link, while it should have been valid, may be blocked or inaccessible from your location.

Let's try one more time with a very common and stable image source. This time, I will also provide the full corrected code again to ensure there are no copying and pasting errors that might be affecting the display.

Please try these steps again, being extra careful to copy the entire code block.

How to Fix the Code
Open the turing_presentation.html file in a text editor.

Delete all the existing code.

Copy all of the code in the block below, from the very first line (<!DOCTYPE html>) to the very last line (</html>).

Paste the new, complete code into your file.

Save the file and refresh your web browser.

This version uses a different image URL that is widely accessible.

        <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
        <p>Alan Mathison Turing was born in London in **1912**. As a child, he showed an early interest in science and mathematics, often pursuing his own unique methods, which frustrated some of his teachers.</p>
            <p>He attended King's College, Cambridge, where he graduated with distinction in mathematics and was later elected a fellow. He also had a passion for long-distance running, reportedly training at an almost Olympic level.</p>

    <div id="slide3" class="slide">
        <h2>Major Contributions to Computing</h2>
        <h3>The Turing Machine</h3>
        <p>In his 1936 paper, "On Computable Numbers," Turing introduced the **Turing machine**, a theoretical model of a universal computer. This abstract device laid the **foundational principles for the digital computers** we use today, demonstrating that a single machine could be programmed to solve any computable problem.</p>
        <h3>WWII Codebreaking</h3>
        <p>During World War II, Turing worked at Bletchley Park, the British codebreaking center. He was instrumental in deciphering messages encrypted by the German **Enigma machine**, a crucial effort that is widely credited with shortening the war and saving countless lives. His work led to the design of the "Bombe," a machine used to break Enigma ciphers.</p>

    <div id="slide4" class="slide">
        <h2>Pioneering Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <h3>The Turing Test</h3>
        <p>In his landmark 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Turing explored the question, "Can machines think?". He proposed the **Turing Test** (or "imitation game") as a way to determine if a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human.</p>
        <p>He suggested that if a human interrogator, communicating via text, could not tell the difference between a machine's responses and a human's, the machine could be considered to be thinking.</p>

        <h2>Influence on Modern AI</h2>
        <p>Turing's work is the theoretical basis for modern AI. His ideas on the **universal machine** underpin all of today's computing systems, while his behavioral approach to intelligence, as outlined in the Turing Test, remains a key concept in the field.</p>
        <p>His early work also discussed the idea of a **"child machine"** that could learn from experience and training, a concept that foreshadowed the rise of modern **machine learning** and neural networks. His vision helped set the stage for the AI applications we see all around us today, from virtual assistants to self-driving cars.</p>
