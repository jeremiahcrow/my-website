    title: "Early Life",
    content: `Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in London, England. From a young age, he showed an exceptional aptitude for mathematics and problem-solving. Despite struggles in classical subjects, he excelled in logic and science. He studied at King’s College, Cambridge, and later earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1938.`,
